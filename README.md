### Hi there 👋

My name is Jean Youn (or you can just simply call me Jean). I'm a software engineer with experience building web applications using Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, React, Redux, Express.js, Mongoose, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and many other technologies. 


I graduated from the Full-stack software enginnering curriculum at App Academy, a 16-week, 1000+ hour web development bootcamp program with a ~3% acceptance rate. Here, I spent over 100 hours a week honing my coding skills and building projects like Mocdoc. 


[Mocdoc](http://mocdoc.herokuapp.com/) is a Zocdoc inspired single-page web app that where patients can search and book appointments with the doctors based on their specialty and insurance coverage. Its backend was built using Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL, and the frontend is built using JavaScript, React, and Redux.  Currently, Mocdoc searches through a list of 14,000 Medi-Cal enrolled Fee-for-Service (FFS) providers in Los Angeles. The provider dataset was acquired from California Health and Human Services Open Data portal so searching for a provider on Mocdoc pulls up real provider data (i.e. name, type of provider credential, type of practice, address, location, and National Provider Identifier). This is a project that encapsulates my passions in empowering patients and coding. 


When I'm not coding, I enjoy... 
- 🎬 watching movies or the Office
- 👀 catching up with NBA, NFL, Premier League, and F1 on YouTube 
- 🏞️ daydreaming about which National/State Parks to visit on my next road trip. 

<!-- Even in my free time, I'm passionate about building good fundamentals, whether that is on the basketball court 🏀 or on VScode 💻 -->
