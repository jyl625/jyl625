### Hi there 👋

My name is Jean Youn (or you can just simply call me Jean). I'm a software engineer with experience building web applications using Ruby on Rails and React / Redux. 

I am just about to finish the software engineering curriculum at App Academy, a highly selective and immersive software engineering bootcamp, where I spent over 100 hours a week honing my coding skills and building projects like MocDoc. 

[MocDoc](http://mocdoc.herokuapp.com/) is a ZocDoc clone that helps patients find and book appointments with the right doctors based on their specialty and insurance coverage. This is a project that really encapsulates my passions in empowering patients and coding. 

When I'm not coding, I enjoy... 
- 🎬 watching movies or the Office
- 👀 catching up with NBA, NFL, Premier League, and F1 on YouTube 
- 🏞️ daydreaming about which National/State Parks to visit on my next road trip. 

Even in my free time, I'm passionate about building good fundamentals, whether that is on the basketball court 🏀 or on VScode 💻
