### Hi there 👋

My name is Jean Youn (or you can just call me Jean). I'm a backend software engineer with a passion for building scalable web applications and microservices. My technical expertise includes Kotlin, Java, Python (FastAPI), Ruby on Rails, Spring Boot, Kafka, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, and AWS.

Currently, I'm working as a backend engineer at Azibo, where I specialize in developing robust microservices, integrating third-party APIs, and maintaining event-driven architectures. At Azibo, I've gained hands-on experience with technologies like Kotlin, Kafka, AWS (S3, EC2, Cognito), PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, and Kubernetes.

Previously, I was a full-stack engineer at Vault Health, where I built performant backend APIs using Python and FastAPI and crafted responsive front-end applications with TypeScript, React, and Next.js. Additionally, I contributed to internal component libraries and emphasized quality assurance through comprehensive testing with Cypress and Jest.


When I'm not coding, I enjoy... 
- 🍿 Exploring great movies and binge-worthy TV shows
- 🏀 Keeping up with NBA, Premier League, and F1 action
- 🏞️ Planning my next hiking adventure or road trip to explore National and State Parks
